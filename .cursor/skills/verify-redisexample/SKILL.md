# Verify redisExample

Generated from source interview following pstack create-verification-skill. Read features/README.md first.

## Launch

From repository root run `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, then `node .cursor/skills/verify-redisexample/verify.cjs`. Install redis-server separately; set REDIS_SERVER_BIN to its executable if it is not on PATH. The helper starts Redis bound to loopback on its own free port with persistence disabled, seeds only its own disposable instance, and terminates only its child processes. The helper reserves a free HTTP port, starts the real app and polls its own expected route until usable. It refuses shared data where applicable. No already-running instance is reused.

## Doctor

The helper checks its own child is running and GETs the app's mapped readiness route before driving: / for weather, /register for chat, /repos/verify-cache-user for Redis, /list for todo. It validates expected content/results during the drive. A TCP listener alone is not success. After surprising failure, clean up and rerun from a fresh instance, never attach to an unknown port.

## Drive

Run `node .cursor/skills/verify-redisexample/verify.cjs`; add `VERIFY_BROWSER=1` for the documented browser path where available. Feature map distinguishes exercised entry points from still-unverified ones. No internal setters or test-only endpoints are used. Redis fixture seeding is explicitly isolated scaffolding for the real cache-hit path, not evidence of the external fetch path.

## Evidence

Default location is a unique /tmp/verify-redisExample- directory, printed at exit. Set VERIFY_EVIDENCE_DIR to a new private persistent path to retain proof across host cleanup. evidence.json records request action, response/status, assertions, boundaries, failure and cleanup. Child logs remain alongside it. Browser mode saves before/after screenshots and requires no page errors. Token responses are redacted. Inspect actual pixels before calling visual behavior verified. One passing path never means the whole map or production passed.

## Cleanup

The helper signals only the processes it created, waits, escalates only on its own children and preserves evidence. Confirm cleaned:true and that evidence.json still exists. App state is disposable: memory users, local MongoMemoryServer, or isolated Redis. Never kill by process name, flush a shared DB, or remove evidence. Existing product logs are not proof to commit.

## Helpers

`node .cursor/skills/verify-redisexample/verify.cjs` is executable and self-contained. Read error/result and exit code. Dependency, browser or Mongo binary failure is a blocker, not a skipped pass.

## Maintenance

After behavior changes use /maintain-verification-skill: reconcile every mapped feature with source and exercise each live; report unreachable prerequisites and product regressions rather than editing the map to hide them.
